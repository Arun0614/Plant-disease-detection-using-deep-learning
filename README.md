# Plant-disease-detection-using-deep-learning

This project aims to detect plant leaf diseases using a deep learning model. A small custom dataset is used to train the model, and a Streamlit web application is created to make real-time predictions by uploading an image.

-> Project Description
The project uses deep learning (MobileNetV2/CNN) to identify diseases in plant leaves.
The model is trained on a small dataset for demonstration.
A Streamlit app is provided for easy user interaction.
The project helps understand image classification using deep learning.

-> Files Included
Plant disease detection.py – Model training code
app_streamlit.py – Streamlit web application
archive/ – Sample dataset (small number of images)
README.md – Project summary

1. How to Run
Install required libraries:
pip install tensorflow
pip install streamlit
pip install numpy
pip install pillow

2. Run the Streamlit app:
  . streamlit run app_streamlit.py

-> Dataset
A small custom dataset is used (only a few images per class) for faster training and demonstration.
Only sample images are uploaded in this repository.
